# Jacob's dotfiles
This is a collection of my personal dotfiles. Some of it is copied from others, some of it is my own preferences.

## Dotbot
I use the self contained tool Dotbot, linked as a submodule to this repo, to install my configurations as symlinks. This makes it a very simple matter to update any new configurations or simply install them to a new home folder.


To install the configuration files, simply:
> ./install

This script will download the Dotbot tool, via git submodules, and refresh the home folder with any configurations.
