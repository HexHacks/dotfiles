# Plugins

Plugins downloaded from the network of comps:

* Vundle: Plugin manager
* YouCompleteMe: C++ completer, like VisualStudio IntelliSense 
* this\_self: a special directory that is not a git submodule. See [this\_self]

## this\_self:

The directory this\_self, represents my own take on things.

## For the Reference
I reference here the (C++) pointer this, as to indicate this repository. I also reference the pythonian self reference to this here self object, called

class this\_self\_repo(Object\)\:
    __init__(**sel**f\)\:
        ln -s ~/.vim/bundle/this_self  

# **TODO**
